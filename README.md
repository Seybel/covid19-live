## About

This project is a live COVID-19 tracker built with Vue.js.  
It was originally powered by the following APIs (now deprecated):

- ~~https://corona.lmao.ninja/~~ (deprecated)  
- ~~https://covidapi.info/~~ (deprecated)  

The project has since been updated to use:  
üëâ [https://disease.sh](https://disease.sh) (actively maintained COVID-19 API)  

So the data fetching features should still work as expected.
